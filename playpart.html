    <p>REGINA. [To herself.] So mother was that kind of woman.<br>
        <br>
        MRS. ALVING. Your mother had many good qualities, Regina.<br>
        <br>
        REGINA. Yes, but she was one of that sort, all the same. Oh, I've often
        suspected it; but--And now, if you please, ma'am, may I be allowed to go
        away at once?<br>
        <br>
        MRS. ALVING. Do you really wish it, Regina?<br>
        <br>
        REGINA. Yes, indeed I do.<br>
        <br>
        MRS. ALVING. Of course you can do as you like; but--<br>
        <br>
        OSWALD. [Goes towards REGINA.] Go away now? Your place is here.</p>
